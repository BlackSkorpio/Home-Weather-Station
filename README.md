# Weather Clock
![Home Weather Station](weather/img/weatherLogo.svg)

This is a fork of Steven Estrella's original work, that you can [see here](https://css-tricks.com/how-i-built-a-gps-powered-weather-clock-with-my-old-iphone-4/).

The difference between the above and my fork is essentially:
## Features
* Multilingual support
* Units formating
* Using SVG instead of raster images
* Supports the Beaufort scale
* Weather conditions is represented better with animation of the background layers

## Todo
Other then the above I'm planing on extending it further with some photography related info:
* Moonrise
* Moonset
* Morning golden hour end
* Evening golden hour start
* Moon phases
* Make it a [Koken plugin](https://kokensupport.com)
